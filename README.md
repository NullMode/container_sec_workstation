# Container Security Workstation Playbook

This is a playbook for setting up a container security workstation with common tools for doing container security reviews.

Rough draft at the moment, still quite a bit of work to do.

## Pre-requisites

- Tested on Ubuntu, may work on other deb based distros
- [Ansible install](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
  - For Ubuntu there's an install script (install_ansible_ubuntu.sh)
- Change the `user` var in the playbook to your username
